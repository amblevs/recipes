Ingredients:
 - 1/2 cup baby spinach leaves
 - 1/2 cup arugula
 - 1 clove garlic, clivered
 - 1 bone-in chicken things with skin 
 - 1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt

Directions:
 1. Stuff spinach leaves, arugula, and garlic under the skin of the chicken thigh and place on a baking dish. Sprinkle with seasoned salt. 
 2. Bake chicken thigh in the oven set at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). 3. Stir, then cover and simmer over low heat for one hour.
